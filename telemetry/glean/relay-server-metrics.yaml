# Status: Draft
# This work is tracked in https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/MPP-3352
#
# This is the first Relay integration with Glean, and is focused on the
# data needed to determine if a Relay user is engaged with the service,
# creating masks and getting emails. There are more metrics planned in the
# future, after we get over the technical hurdles of the first integration.
#
# Remaining critical path work in the code:
# - Merge python_server backend for glean_parser
#   https://github.com/mozilla/glean_parser/pull/653
# - Release glean_parser with python_server backend
# - Add Relay hooks for mask_deleted events
# - Add Relay hooks for mask_label_updated events
# - Add Relay hooks for email_forwarded events
# - Add Relay hooks for email_blocked events
# - Respect opt-out at Firefox Accounts level
# - Request a data review, update bugs and data_reviews
# - Make required changes from data review
# - Delete this status section
